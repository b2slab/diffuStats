abstract = {A relation exists between network proximity of molecular entities in interaction networks, functional similarity and association with diseases. The identification of network regions associated with biological functions and pathologies is a major goal in systems biology. We describe a network diffusion-based pipeline for the interpretation of different types of omics in the context of molecular interaction networks. We introduce the network smoothing index, a network-based quantity that allows to jointly quantify the amount of omics information in genes and in their network neighbourhood, using network diffusion to define network proximity. The approach is applicable to both descriptive and inferential statistics calculated on omics data. We also show that network resampling, applied to gene lists ranked by quantities derived from the network smoothing index, indicates the presence of significantly connected genes. As a proof of principle, we identified gene modules enriched in somatic mutations and transcriptional variations observed in samples of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). In line with the local hypothesis, network smoothing index and network resampling underlined the existence of a connected component of genes harbouring molecular alterations in PRAD.},

@article{labelpropagation,
  abstract = {The expansion of the Internet over the last decade and the proliferation of online social communities, such as Facebook, Google+, and Twitter, as well as multimedia sharing sites, such as YouTube, Flickr, and Picasa, has led to a vast increase of available information to the user. In the case of multimedia data, such as images and videos, fast querying and processing of the available information requires the annotation of the multimedia data with semantic descriptors, that is, labels. However, only a small proportion of the available data are labeled. The rest should undergo an annotation-labeling process. The necessity for the creation of automatic annotation algorithms gave birth to label propagation and semi-supervised learning. In this study, basic concepts in graph-based label propagation methods are discussed. Methods for proper graph construction based on the structure of the available data and label inference methods for spreading label information from a few labeled data to a larger set of unlabeled data are reviewed. Applications of label propagation algorithms in digital media, as well as evaluation metrics for measuring their performance, are presented.},
