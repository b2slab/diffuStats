CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

    o Five diffusion kernels available, they can be computed
      from an 'igraph' object.

    o Diffusion implementations divided between 'diffuse_raw'
      for deterministic scores and 'diffuse_mc' for permutation
      analysis, which is parallelised. In total, seven diffusion scores
      are accessible through the 'diffusion' function.

    o Performance evaluation wrapped in the 'perf' function.

    o Helper functions in helpers.R (to plot diffusion scores, to check if a
      kernel matrix is actually a kernel, to extract largest CC from a graph)
