Description: Label propagation approaches are a widely used 
    procedure in computational biology for giving context
    to molecular entities using network data.
    Node labels, which can derive from gene expression,
    genome-wide association studies,
    protein domains or metabolomics profiling,
    are propagated to their neighbours in the network,
    effectively smoothing the scores through
    prior annotated knowledge and prioritising novel candidates.
    The R package diffuStats contains a 
    collection of diffusion kernels and scoring approaches
    that facilitates their computation and benchmarking.
